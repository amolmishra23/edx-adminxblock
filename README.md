# AdminXBlock

This project is done for the completion of my internship at IIT Bombay Eklavya Summer Internship 2017, under the guidance of Mrs. Aparna for the enhancement of IITBombayX platform.

A system administrator, is a person who is responsible for the upkeep, configuration, and reliable operation of computer systems; especially multi-user computers, such as servers. The system administrator seeks to ensure that the uptime, performance, resources, and security of the entire system. To meet these needs, a system administrator may acquire, install, or upgrade computer components and software; provide routine automation; maintain security policies; troubleshoot; train or supervise staff, or offer technical support for projects. For all the above mentioned things, which is mostly performed through command line, pertaining to its complexities and thus cannot be done by all. The objective of the project is to create an XBlock which will perform all the tasks which a system administrator frequently performs in the lifecycle of the Open edX server and make the job of system administrator easy. 

Operations currently supported by the XBlock:
- [Importing a course from github](https://github.com/amolmishra23/edx-adminxblock/wiki/Importing-a-course-from-git-into-project)
- [Activating and deactivating a user](https://github.com/amolmishra23/edx-adminxblock/wiki/Activating-and-deactivating-a-user).
- [Generating certificate for all users/single user](https://github.com/amolmishra23/edx-adminxblock/wiki/Generating-Certificate)
