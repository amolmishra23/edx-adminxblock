# AdminXBlock

This project is done for as a part of my summer internship for IIT Bombay, to be used on IITBombayX platform. 

A system  administrator,  is  a  person  who  is responsible  for  the  upkeep, configuration, and reliable operation of computer systems, especially multi-user computers, such as servers. The system administrator seeks to ensure that the uptime, performance, resources, and security of the entire system. To meet these needs,  a  system  administrator  may  acquire,  install,  or  upgrade  computer components and software; provide routine automation; maintain security policies;troubleshoot; train or supervise staff; or offer technical support for projects. For all  the  above  mentioned  things,  which  is  mostly  performed  through  command line, pertaining to its complexities and thus cannot be done by all. The objective of the project is to create an XBlock which will perform all the tasks which a system administrator frequently performs in the lifecycle of the Open edX server and make the job of system administrator easy.

Operations currently supported by the XBlock:
- Importing a course from github.
- Activating and deactivating a user.
- Generating certificate for all users/single user.
- Exporting a course.
- Asset collections command.
- Deleting a course.

This XBlock can be imported into any course in edx. And all the system administrator's frequently performed tasks can be done with ease.
